# Architecture Overview

## Modules

### 1. `turing_machine.py`

Defines the `TuringMachine` class, encapsulating the behavior of a Turing machine. It manages the tape, head position, current state, and execution steps.

### 2. `simulation.py`

Handles the enumeration and simulation of all possible Turing machines based on defined states and symbols. Utilizes multiprocessing to parallelize simulations for efficiency.

### 3. `utils.py`

Contains utility functions and shared constants to support other modules.

## Workflow

1. **Enumeration**: Generates all possible transition functions based on the number of states and symbols.

2. **Simulation**: Each transition function is simulated using the `TuringMachine` class to determine if it halts and its productivity.

3. **Aggregation**: Collects results to identify the most productive and longest-running halting machines.

## Future Enhancements

- **Configurable Parameters**: Allow dynamic configuration of states, symbols, and other parameters via configuration files or command-line arguments.

- **Optimization**: Implement more efficient algorithms or heuristics to reduce the simulation space.

- **Visualization**: Add visualization tools to represent machine behavior and tape states.

- **Extended Testing**: Increase test coverage for more robust validation.
